# energy-data-pdf-extractor

I can strongly recommend using https://www.adobe.com/acrobat/online/pdf-to-excel.html to extract eny tables or data from pdf file.
Libs I found, such as aspose-pdf, itextpdf, spire.office were not coping with given table format.
With Apache PDFBox it was easy to read text, but it's format was tought to split into any data structure (some numbers has space etc.)
